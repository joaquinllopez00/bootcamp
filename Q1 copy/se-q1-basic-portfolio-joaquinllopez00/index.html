    <h2>Skills</h2>
    <p>
      Over the course of my first month at
      <a href="https://www.kenzie.academy/"><i>Kenzie Academy</i></a> I have
      already learned skills that I feel will be very important to my future 
      success as a software engineer. These skils include, but are not limited to:
      <ul>
        <li> Basic HTML structure</li>
        <li> Basic Javascript:</li>
        <ul> 
          <li>Functions</li>
          <li>Use of Arrays</li>
        </ul>
       <li> As well as <em> much, much </em> more. </li>
      </ul>

    <h2>Early-life</h2>
    <p>
     I was born in Community East hospital, which is convienantly named after the side of
     Indianapolis it is on. I was raised on the East side, moving several times throughout my early child hood, all of the places except one 
     being within three miles form each other. This was very rough as a kid, because it never gave me time to adjust 
     to one set location. I never had any true child-hood friends that I was raised with, and all of my close pals 
     came through school.

    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>
      For all of my primary education, I attended Warren Township schools throughout the East side of Indianapolis.
      Early on in my school career, I found that my parents looked at this as a disadvantage, given the 
      high crime rate on the East side of Indianapolis. While initially I agreed (as most kids do) with my parents, 
      I started looking at it as an advantage over kids in surrounding areas. I found, especially in high school, that 
      the side of Indianapolis I lived on could be described as what some would call, a <i>melting-pot</i>. Getting
      to see different cultures everyday, instead of just being apart of a school that is identified by one culture,
      or one-language even, made me an exteremly open-minded person. Instead of being defensive about what I personally believed,
      I learned to respect other peoples personal beliefs, and approach every situation with an open mind. If theres one 
      thing I would accredit most of my morals too, it would be the East side of Indianapolis.

          While Warren Central HS is a fairly large school, it is still crowded and hard to avoid interaction with 
          a population of 6,000&lt; students!
